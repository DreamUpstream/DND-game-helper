## OPEN SOURCE DND GAME HELPER - WORK IN PROGRESS

This is a work in progress project to create a DnD game helper. The idea is to create a tool that can help the DM to manage the game and the players to play it. It also aims to be a tool that can be used by the players to create and manage their characters and connect DM and players in a single platform with shared session data and character sheets.
